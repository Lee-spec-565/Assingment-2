        <div class="intro">
            New York’s history is a fascinating journey that gives every landmark a deeper meaning. Before it became a
            world-famous destination, the region was home to Native American communities such as the Lenape, who lived
            along its rivers and forests. In 1624, Dutch settlers established New Amsterdam on Manhattan Island, and a
            few decades later, the English took over and renamed it New York setting the foundation for the thriving
            city we know today.
        </div>

        <div class="highlights">
            As the centuries passed, New York became a gateway of hope and opportunity. Millions of immigrants arrived
            through Ellis Island, bringing diverse cultures and dreams that shaped the city’s energy and identity. With
            the rise of landmarks like the Statue of Liberty, the Brooklyn Bridge, and early skyscrapers, New York grew
            into a global symbol of ambition, innovation, and possibility. Today, every street, museum, and neighborhood
            reflects the rich history that makes New York an unforgettable place to explore.
