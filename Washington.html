        <div class="intro">
            Washington's history is rich and diverse, shaped by Native American cultures, early European exploration,
            and rapid economic growth fueled by logging, fishing, trade, and technology.
        </div>
        <div class="highlights">
            Indigenous peoples inhabited the region for thousands of years before European settlers arrived. Washington
            became a U.S. territory in 1853 and a state in 1889. Its unique blend of indigenous heritage and pioneer
            spirit continues to influence the state's vibrant culture and dynamic economy today.
