        <h2>History of Florida</h2>
        <div class="intro">
            Florida’s history is a rich tapestry woven from Native American cultures, European exploration, and diverse
            colonial influences.
        </div>
        <div class="highlights">
            Indigenous peoples thrived in Florida for thousands of years before Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León
            arrived in 1513, naming it "La Florida." Spain established one of the earliest European settlements in St.
            Augustine in 1565, which remains the oldest continuously inhabited city in the U.S.
            <br><br>
            Florida changed hands between Spain, Britain, and the United States multiple times before becoming a U.S.
            territory in 1821 and the 27th state in 1845. The state’s strategic location made it a key player in the
            Civil War and a hotspot for trade and tourism.
            <br><br>
            In the 20th century, Florida’s economy blossomed with the growth of agriculture, space exploration at Cape
            Canaveral, and a booming tourism industry highlighted by attractions like Walt Disney World.
            <br><br>
            Today, Florida’s multicultural heritage and dynamic growth continue to shape its vibrant culture and
            economy.
