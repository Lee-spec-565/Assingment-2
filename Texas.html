        <h2>History of Texas</h2>
        <div class="intro">
            Texas has a rich and complex history shaped by its indigenous peoples, Spanish and Mexican rule, and its
            fight for independence and statehood.
        </div>
        <div class="highlights">
            Indigenous groups lived in Texas thousands of years before European settlers arrived. Spanish explorers
            claimed the land in the 16th century, establishing missions and settlements. Texas declared independence
            from Mexico in 1836 after a series of conflicts including the famous Battle of the Alamo and won
            independence following the Battle of San Jacinto.
            <br><br>
            Texas joined the United States in 1845, leading to the Mexican-American War that defined its southern
            border. The state played a key role in the Civil War and Reconstruction. Later, the discovery of oil
            propelled its economy, making Texas a powerhouse of energy production and innovation.
            <br><br>
            Today, Texas blends this pioneer spirit and diverse cultural heritage into a vibrant identity, influencing
            American culture and economy.
